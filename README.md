# Kirby Star Jump!

As part of my learning journey in JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I built a simply fun web browser game.

In this **Kirby Star Jump!**, you can guide Kirby as he jumps from star to star!

**Play it here:** [https://angelbelroth.github.io/KirbyStarJump/]

Let me know when you try it out — how many stars can your Kirby jump? ✨

**N.B.** Best experience on Chrome/Firefox at **1600×800** screen size or larger.

## About

Kirby Star Jump is a web browser game built with vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts (classes/constructors, encapsulation, and simple game loops).
The repository contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image assets to run the game locally or on GitHub Pages.

## Gameplay

* Guide Kirby as he jumps between stars.
* Score increases as you land on new stars.
* Avoid falling off the bottom of the screen — steady timing makes the difference.

### Controls

* **Left/Right** arrow keys to move horizontally
* Kirby can jump up when he lands on a star!

## Features

* Built with OOP-style JavaScript
* Comaptible with Chrome & Firefox
* Lightweight — no build step required
* Best at wide desktop resolutions **1600×800** screen size or larger.

## Run locally

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngelBelRoth/KirbyStarJump.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended).

Alternatively, serve locally with a static server (recommended for some browsers):

```bash
# using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
